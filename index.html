                <h2>Sirkeci</h2>
                Sirkeci (pronounced [siɾkeci]) is a quarter in the Eminönü neighborhood of the Fatih district of the city of Istanbul, Turkey. 
                The neighborhood borders to the North the mouth of the Golden Horn, to the West the neighborhood of Bahçekapı,
                to the East the Topkapi Palace area, and to the South the Cağaloğlu neighborhood. Sirkeci hosts Sirkeci Station,
                the Southeastern (thus "Oriental") long distance passenger train terminus in Europe for the Orient Express.
                The neighborhood consists mostly of commercial and tourist oriented uses. A combination of small shops,
                hans (larger workshops), offices intermingle with boutique hotels, traditional Turkish restaurants, 
                Turkish and foreign-language bookstores, and tourist offices.
                Famous as the terminating point for the Orient Express, Sirkeci remains one of the main travel hubs for Istanbul, 
                connecting suburban train, tram and ferry systems. 
                The Sirkeci Station of the Turkish State Railways is the terminating node of the European railway network leading into Istanbul, 
                the two main lines from Thessaloniki, Greece and Bucharest, Romania. Moreover, 
                this is the terminal of the suburban railway line leading to Halkalı along the Marmara shore. 
                The Marmaray project, an underwater railway tunnel under the Bosporus connecting the European and Asian networks, also serves this area.
                <h2>Eminönü</h2>
                Eminönü is a former district of Istanbul in Turkey, currently a quarter within the Fatih district,
                which is the capital district of Istanbul and of Istanbul Province. 
                Eminönü covers roughly the area on which the ancient city of Byzantium was built.
                The Galata Bridge crosses the Golden Horn and connects Karaköy (historic Galata) at north with Eminönü at south. 
                Eminönü is located at the point where the Golden Horn connects with the southern entrance of the Bosphorus strait,
                near the Sea of Marmara. Up on the hill stands Topkapı Palace, the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Camii) and Hagia Sophia (Aya Sofya). 
                It was a part of the Fatih district until 1928, 
                which covered the whole peninsular area (the old Stamboul) within the Roman city walls - that area which was formerly the Byzantine capital
                Constantinople. Since the resident population of Eminönü is low today, it rejoined the capital district Fatih in 2009.
